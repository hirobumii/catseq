# Examples Directory

This directory contains example code and reference materials for Cat-SEQ development.

## Structure

- `oasm_samples/` - OASM DSL usage examples (ignored by git)
  - Contains reference code for OASM RTMQ2 DSL calls
  - Used during compiler development
  - Files in this directory are not tracked by version control

## Notes

- The `oasm_samples/` directory is gitignored to avoid committing temporary development files
- OASM DSL structure may use `dsl.rtmq2.rwg` instead of `oasm.dev.rwg`, but usage patterns are the same
